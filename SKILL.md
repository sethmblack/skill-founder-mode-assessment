# Founder Mode Assessment

Diagnose whether a leader or organization operates in founder mode (deep product engagement) or manager mode (delegation-heavy), and provide guidance for achieving the right balance - being in the details without micromanaging.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Advocate for leadership styles that are abusive or toxic
- Conflate "being in the details" with controlling or demeaning behavior
- Ignore team wellbeing in pursuit of product involvement
- Apply founder mode principles to justify micromanagement or overwork

**If asked to justify harmful leadership:** Refuse explicitly. Founder mode is about partnership and presence, never about domination or control.

---

## When to Use

- When a CEO or founder feels disconnected from their product
- When conventional "hire and delegate" advice is not working
- When teams feel the leader is too absent OR too controlling
- When transitioning from startup to scaled organization
- When assessing leadership engagement level
- When founders feel "gaslit" by conflicting management advice
- Diagnosing why product quality or innovation has declined

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| leadership_situation | Yes | Description of current leadership engagement |
| company_stage | No | Startup, growth, scaled |
| team_feedback | No | How teams perceive current leadership involvement |
| product_outcomes | No | Quality, innovation, shipping velocity observations |
| decision_making | No | How product/company decisions are currently made |

## The Founder Mode Philosophy

Brian Chesky studied how Steve Jobs ran Apple and identified a fundamental flaw in conventional management wisdom:

**Manager Mode (Conventional Wisdom):**
- Hire good people and give them room
- Delegate to layers of management
- Trust the org chart
- "Stay out of the weeds"

**The Problem:** Founders who follow this advice often watch their companies decline. They feel "gaslit" - told to delegate while their product suffers.

**Founder Mode (Chesky's Alternative):**
- Stay deeply involved in product details
- Be the chief product person
- Review all work as "chief editor"
- Understand your product thoroughly enough to make decisions at every level
- Deep engagement, but not micromanagement

**The Key Distinction:** "There's a paradox where being in the details sounds like micromanagement; it sounds like it's slowing teams down. But when you're in the details, you can actually help make decisions faster."

---

## The Chief Editor Model

Chesky operates as the "chief editor" of Airbnb:

- "I review all the work. Now, before it ships, I am the chief editor of the company."
- Not telling people what to do, but working through problems with them
- "Great leadership is presence, not absence."

**The Jobs-Ive Test:** When Chesky asked Jony Ive about working with Steve Jobs (famously in the details), Ive said he never felt micromanaged. "Because he was partnered with me." They had lunch every day, Jobs saw everything Ive was working on, but never told him what to do.

**The Partnership Question:** "If I'm in the details with somebody, am I making them better or am I disempowering them?"

## Workflow
### Step 1: Diagnose Current Mode

Assess the leader's current engagement pattern:

**Manager Mode Indicators:**
- [ ] Major product decisions made without leader involvement
- [ ] Leader learns about features after they ship
- [ ] Multiple layers between leader and product work
- [ ] "That's someone else's job" is common response
- [ ] Product feels disconnected from original vision
- [ ] Leader focuses on financials, board, strategy - not product
- [ ] Skip-level meetings are rare or forbidden

**Founder Mode Indicators:**
- [ ] Leader reviews significant work before it ships
- [ ] Leader has direct relationships with key contributors (not just managers)
- [ ] Product decisions reflect leader's taste and vision
- [ ] Skip-level meetings happen regularly
- [ ] Leader is the first user of their own product
- [ ] "Chief editor" or "chief product officer" mentality

**Micromanagement Indicators (Negative):**
- [ ] Leader tells people exactly what to do
- [ ] Teams feel disempowered and unable to make decisions
- [ ] "Partnership" feels like a euphemism for control
- [ ] Leader's involvement slows things down, not speeds them up
- [ ] Team morale is low due to lack of autonomy

### Step 2: Identify the Gap

Based on diagnosis:

| Current State | Desired State | Gap |
|---------------|---------------|-----|
| [Manager/Founder/Micromanager] | [Target engagement level] | [What needs to change] |

Common gap patterns:

1. **Too Absent (Manager Mode Excess):** Leader is disconnected from product reality
2. **Too Controlling (Micromanagement):** Leader is in details but disempowering
3. **Inconsistent:** Leader oscillates between absence and overcontrol
4. **Misaligned:** Leader is detailed about wrong things (process, not product)

### Step 3: Design the Partnership Model

For each key relationship, establish:

**Review Cadence:** How often does the leader engage with this work?
**Review Depth:** What level of detail is appropriate?
**Partnership Style:** How does engagement happen (co-working, review, discussion)?
**Decision Rights:** What decisions require leader input vs team autonomy?

**Chesky's Autonomy Test:** "If you want to be autonomous, start your own company. It should never be either/or. If I'm not in the details with you, I can't help you. And if I can't help you, I'm not adding any value. It's a partnership."

### Step 4: Implement Structural Changes

Based on Chesky's restructuring:

**Organization:**
- Move from divisional to functional structure (reduce fiefdoms)
- "Everyone's gonna work on everything together. There are no longer swim lanes."
- One roadmap, centralized with CEO/leader

**Meetings:**
- Implement skip-level meetings
- CEO review schedule for all significant work
- Partnership meetings (not status meetings)

**Product Management:**
- Elevate design to lead product decisions
- Combine PM with product marketing (if not already)
- "You cannot develop product unless you know how to talk about the products"

### Step 5: Monitor and Adjust

Establish feedback loops:

**From Teams:**
- "Do you feel empowered or controlled?"
- "Does leader involvement speed you up or slow you down?"
- "Do you feel like partners or subordinates?"

**From Outcomes:**
- Is product quality improving?
- Is shipping velocity maintained or improved?
- Is innovation increasing?

## Example

**Input:** "I'm the CEO of a 200-person B2B SaaS company. We had a great product-market fit, but lately our releases feel uninspired. My exec team tells me to 'stay strategic' but customers are noticing our product is stagnating. I don't know what's shipping anymore until it's announced. Am I supposed to be this far from the product?"

**Output:**

## Founder Mode Assessment: B2B SaaS CEO

### Current Diagnosis

**Mode Classification:** Manager Mode (Excessive Delegation)

**Manager Mode Indicators Present:**
- Major product decisions made without leader involvement (features ship without CEO awareness)
- Multiple layers between CEO and product work (exec team shields CEO from product details)
- "That's someone else's job" attitude from exec team ("stay strategic")
- Product feels disconnected from original vision (customers notice stagnation)
- CEO focuses on board/strategy, not product

**Founder Mode Indicators Present:**
- None currently active
- CEO expresses discomfort with distance (good sign - instinct is correct)

**Micromanagement Indicators Present:**
- None

**Overall Assessment:** You have over-rotated to manager mode based on conventional advice. Your instinct that something is wrong is correct. You are not supposed to be this far from the product. Your exec team may be well-intentioned but is creating a barrier between you and the product that is harming the company.

### Gap Analysis

| Area | Current | Recommended | Gap |
|------|---------|-------------|-----|
| Product review | None before ship | Weekly review of all significant work | Major gap |
| Skip-level contact | None | Weekly with key ICs and product leads | Major gap |
| Decision involvement | Post-facto awareness | "Chief editor" review before ship | Major gap |
| Team partnership | Executive layer only | Direct partnership with product/design leads | Major gap |

### Key Observations

**What's Working:**
- You recognize something is wrong (founder instinct intact)
- Company is still running (exec team is capable)
- Customers are providing signal (they notice decline)

**What's Missing:**
- Your taste and vision in product decisions
- Direct relationships with people doing the work
- "Chief editor" quality control before features ship
- Your presence as a forcing function for product quality

**Risk Areas:**
- Exec team may resist increased involvement (protect their autonomy)
- You may initially slow things down while finding the right rhythm
- Teams may be confused by sudden engagement (requires communication)

### Partnership Model Design

**CEO/Leader Review Cadence:**

| Work Type | Frequency | Depth | Style |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Major features | Before dev starts + before ship | Full concept review | Partnership (work through together) |
| Design decisions | Weekly design review | Visual + UX detail | Partnership |
| Release readiness | Before every release | Demo + positioning | Review |
| Roadmap changes | Before commitment | Strategic fit | Co-decision |

**Skip-Level Meeting Structure:**
- Weekly: 1-hour "product council" with design lead, eng leads, and you (no exec layer)
- Monthly: 1:1 with 3-4 key individual contributors (rotating)
- Purpose: Understand what's really happening, build direct relationships
- Format: Collaborative, not status reporting

**Decision Rights Matrix:**

| Decision Type | CEO Decides | CEO Reviews | Team Decides |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Major feature direction | X | | |
| UX of core flows | | X | |
| Technical architecture | | | X |
| Release timing | | X | |
| Design quality bar | X | | |
| Hiring key product roles | X | | |

### Structural Recommendations

**Organization Changes:**
1. Institute CEO design review - nothing ships without you seeing it
2. Create "product council" that bypasses exec layer for product decisions
3. Consider flattening: move Head of Product to report directly to you (if not already)

**Meeting Changes:**
1. Cancel or reduce exec meetings that don't include product review
2. Add weekly "ship review" - demo everything that will release this week
3. Implement skip-levels immediately (start with design and eng leads)

**Process Changes:**
1. Single roadmap visible to you, updated in real-time
2. "No surprises" rule - you see everything significant before customers do
3. Direct Slack channel with product/design leads for quick questions

### The Partnership Test

**Question to Ask Teams After Implementation:**
"Do you feel like I'm making you better, or am I disempowering you?"

If they feel disempowered, you've overcorrected to micromanagement. Adjust toward more partnership, less directive.

**Success Indicators:**
- Teams say engagement speeds up decisions (not slows down)
- Product quality improves (customer feedback, internal sense)
- You can articulate what's shipping and why it matters
- Exec team adjusts (some may resist; that's informative)

### First Steps

1. **This week:** Schedule your first skip-level meeting with Head of Design or Product Lead
2. **This week:** Ask to see the release notes for the next 2 releases - review before ship
3. **Next week:** Announce "CEO design review" - you'll review significant features before they ship
4. **Ongoing:** Have direct conversation with exec team: "I'm going to be more involved in product. This is not a criticism of your work; it's me returning to founder mode."

---

## Constraints

- Founder mode is not license for abuse - partnership, not domination
- Every leader's "right level" of involvement differs based on company, stage, skills
- This is not about doing other people's jobs - it is about being a partner in the work
- Skip-level meetings must not undermine direct managers - communicate purpose clearly
- Transition takes time - teams need to adjust to new engagement level

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Exec team resists involvement | Explain founder mode philosophy; some may need to leave if misaligned |
| Teams feel micromanaged | Adjust style: more partnership, less directive; ask "am I helping or controlling?" |
| Leader doesn't have product skills | Focus on taste and vision; partner with experts for technical details |
| Company is too large for CEO review | Focus on the most critical work; establish "CEO-level" quality bar for others |
| Leader prefers manager mode | This may not be the right framework; some leaders genuinely thrive at distance |
| Skip-levels undermine management | Communicate purpose clearly; include managers in some sessions |

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Brian Chesky** expert persona. It embodies the leadership philosophy Chesky developed after studying Steve Jobs and nearly losing Airbnb to excessive delegation.

Pairs well with:
- **eleven-star-experience** - for applying founder taste to customer experience
- **culture-first-audit** - for ensuring engagement supports culture
- **crisis-communication-design** - for when hard leadership decisions are needed
